      Currently, most of my work is proprietary,
      but I look forawrd to sharing my new learnings as I investigate serverless deployments
      with Zappa and the Serverless framework, the AWS ecosystem (in particular RDS to use 
      with serverless deployments), managing authentication with third party providers such
      as Firebase and Auth0, Docker gotchas (e.g. adding secrets to docker-compose...trickier
      to manage than simple .env files!), and my dive into deep learning (with Udacity).
    </p>

    <p>
      Please do not be perturbed by my recent drop in GitHub/GitLab activity. I recently got
      married (November 2018), so I had a 4-week break and then started working at Griffith where
      we run a privately hosted GitLab server, logging in with my staff account. Rest assured,
      I am pushing bucketloads of code every day, I just can't share it with you! I did write a
      nice little paginator for use with SQL-Alchemy though, perhaps I could learn to deploy that
      to PyPy and share that process :)

      Gary Burgmann is a student software engineer and is currently working for Griffith Univeristy's 
      eResearch team as a developer. His current focus at work is rebuilding a clinical trials
      application, from Plone to a SPA architecture of ReactJS/Pyramid/MySQL, where his role is to
      develop the API in Pyramid. It has been an interesting learning experience to apply continous
      integration with a Docker & Jenkins pipeline. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He is also developing a web application for the Queensland State Archives to assist
      in automatic reconstruction of document pieces, using Django as the framework and the
      JavaScript library Konva for the manipulation of individual pieces where needed. Previously
      he has also worked as a developer on a large project with an Angular/Laravel/MySQL stack.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work, he thoroughly enjoys working within the Django ecosystem and is currently
      developing two personal projects utilising the framework. He has previously deployed applications
      to Digital Ocean (including this one!), one of which was a ReactJS/ExpressJS/Mongo stack for
      his wedding to receive guest RSVPs and provide information for guests. Moving forward, his aim
      is to utilize serverless deployments with AWS, implementing the Serverless framework for NodeJS
      or Zappa for Django/Flask projects, a SPA architecture consisting of server-side rendered ReactJS
      with NextJS, and Amazon's Relational Database Service with Postgres, as his stack of choice. He
      is also very keen to learn more data science related techniques, having only briefly used SciKit
      learn modules for high level machine learning tasks in the past, now currently diving into PyTorch
      with Udacity.
